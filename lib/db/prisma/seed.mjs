Prohibited trading behavior
The final policy must describe prohibited conduct clearly and explain how it is assessed.

Risk disclosure
Trading involves risk. This evaluation service does not guarantee profits, trading success, or a financial outcome.

Explain what customer information is collected, why it is used, retention periods, and how privacy requests are handled. This section requires review.

Limitation of liability
The final scope and enforceability of any limitation must be determined by qualified counsel before publication.
